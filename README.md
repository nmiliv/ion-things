# ion-things
Electrostatic iteratative plasma particle tracker. Based on the FFX code developed by Cody Farnell. You should really check out the [PhD thesis](https://projects-web.engr.colostate.edu/ionstand/publications/papers/Farnell%20-%20Cody%20Dissertation.pdf) on it, it's a great resource for learning about ion thrusters.

Main sim file is etest2.m, everything else is a supporting function. etest1.m is a deprecated version.
